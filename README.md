# Second note to teacher regarding the Mars weather app
- Mars Weather API is not currently working so I had to shift yet again to another API. This time to openweathermap that is the final project.

# Note to teacher regarding the original Faleev System app
- Hours and hours of trial and error amounted to nothing. (I'll shift to building a Mars weather app (API: https://api.nasa.gov/assets/insight/InSight%20Weather%20API%20Documentation.pdf) as the lack of IQ and excess of work shifts before release probably prevent me from doing anything more complicated...)
